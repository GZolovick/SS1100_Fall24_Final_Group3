#Firing a Thruster for 5 seconds with flow rate of 0.02 kg/s and exhaust velocity of 1000 m/s
Thruster 1 is within limits
Velocity change is 0.2 m/s

#Firing a Thruster for 3 seconds with flow rate of 0.06 kg/s and exhaust velocity of 1000 m/s
Thruster 2 exceeded Flow Rate by 0.01 kg/s
Velocity change is 0.36 m/s

#Firing a Thruster for 10 seconds with flow rate of 0.05 kg/s and exhaust velocity of 2000 m/s
Thruster 3 is within limits
Velocity change is 2 m/s

##Check Plus Result
Thruster 1 is within limits
Thruster 2 is within limits
Thruster 3 is within limits
Velocity change is 2.4 m/s in the X direction, 0.48 m/s in the Y direction, and 0.12 m/s in the Z direction
