## Final Project: Programming Spacecraft Systems
## Results and Responses at the Bottom of the Page

### Assignment
- **Instructions**: Work in groups of four to complete the steps outlined in the project instructions.
- **Submission**: All of your submission will go here in this repository, to include this README file to hold your writeup.

### Procedure
#### Preparation
- Employ programming skills to solve problems related to spacecraft subsystems.
- Develop code and responses to tasks in various sections.
- Experience working with code and collaborating on a coding project.

#### Requirements
1. Complete all tasks listed in each section, paying attention to the Evaluation subsections.
2. Use MatLab to complete at least one of the tasks.
3. Submit the project using GitHub, replacing the content of this README file with your writeup and presentation of the work.

#### Subsystems and Tasks
Reaction Control Subsystem (RCS): Malfunction detection and velocity change calculation.\
Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS): Temperature control function.\
Attitude Control Subsystem (ACS): Attitude determination and rotation calculations.\
Command and Data Handling (C&DH): Command parsing and routing.\
Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS): Power budget analysis and battery charging calculations.\
Remote Sensing Payload: Data ingestion, radiance to reflectance conversion, and image rescaling.
